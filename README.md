# Next.js Ecommerce Store

## This project aims to design and develop an ecommerce store using Next.js. The store will feature essential functionalities such as product listing, single product pages, cart management, checkout process, and a thank you page. It will also incorporate cookies for cart management and utilize a PostgreSQL database for storing product information.

## The project is created to provide a custom ecommerce solution tailored to specific requirements. While there are existing ecommerce platforms available, building a custom solution offers flexibility and customization options that may not be available in pre-built solutions.

### This project is created by Johanna-Maria-Alexandra Oprisan.

#### The project utilizes Next.js framework for building the frontend components. It incorporates TypeScript for type safety and utilizes JSDoc for documenting code. Backend functionalities are implemented using PostgreSQL for database management. Automated tests are included to ensure the reliability of critical functionalities.

##### The software runs as a web application accessible through a web browser.

###### The project was initiated on the 30.01.2024. It has evolved over time to incorporate additional features and improvements.
